*Act 3, Scene 2, 71-79*

CALIBAN — Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him
I’th’afternoon to sleep; there thou mayst brain him,
having first seized his books: or with a log,
batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
or cut his weasand with thy knife. Remember
first to possess his books; for without them
he’s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
one spirit to command: they all do hate him
as rootedly as I. Burn but his books.

*Act 3, Scene 2, 109-129*

*[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor an pipe]*

STEPHANO — What is this same?

TRINCULO — This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.

STEPHANO — If thou be’st a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou be’st a devil, take’t as thou list.

TRINCULO — O, forgive me my sins!

STEPHANO — He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!

CALIBAN — Are thou afeard?

STEPHANO — No, monster, not I.

CALIBAN — Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,
sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not:
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
that if I then had waked after long sleep,
will make me sleep again, and then in dreaming,
the clouds methought would open and show riches
ready to drop upon me, that when I waked
I cried to dream again.

STEPHANO — This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.

CALIBAN — When Prospero is destroyed.
