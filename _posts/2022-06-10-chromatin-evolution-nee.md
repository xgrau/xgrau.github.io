We have recently published a new paper on the evolution of chromatin in eukaryotes: 

> **A phylogenetic and proteomic reconstruction of eukaryotic chromatin evolution**, Grau-Bov√© et al., [Nature Ecology and Evolution 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-022-01771-6)

For a quick summary of the paper, maybe you'll find this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/xgraubove/status/1466324623780364295) useful.

This paper was published with a companion database where you can browse and download our comparative genomic analyses of the eukaryotic chromatin machinery. You can check it out [here](https://sebe-lab.shinyapps.io/chromatin_evolution/).
