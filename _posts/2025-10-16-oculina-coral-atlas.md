We have recently published a paper on the Mediterranean coral *Oculina patagonica*, a remarkable and highly resilient species that is able to live and thrive with or without its symbiotic algae — what we usually call "facultative endosymbiosis".

We particularly enjoyed working with this because, IMO, it's a nice example of a very fruitful paradigm in 'omics' research for non-model organisms: a genome and a single-cell transcriptomic atlas done shoulder-to-shoulder, both of them providing new records of the genetic and functional underpinnings of previously understudied species, and each of them helping us better understand the other. There are a few examples of this at work through the paper — just check [this thread by Arnau Sebé-Pedrós](https://bsky.app/profile/arnausebe.bsky.social/post/3m3azphzuvk2e) on Bluesky.

This approach is one of the scientific cornerstones of the fledgling [Biodiversity Cell Atlas initiative](https://biodiversitycellatlas.org/), which will benefit greatly from the vast trove of new genomes from all across the tree of life published by massive genome-sequencing projects such as the Darwin Tree of Life, Earth Biogenome, and ERGA.
