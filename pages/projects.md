I am currently working on the evolution of insecticide resistance adaptations in *Anopheles* mosquitoes responsible for malaria transmission as part of the [*Anopheles gambiae* 1000 genomes](https://www.malariagen.net/projects/ag1000g).

The recurrent evolution of new resistance mechanisms in insect vectors is a major obstacle in our current efforts to curb and eradicate infectious diseases like malaria. In particular, I am involved in the analysis of data from the [*Anopheles gambiae* 1000 genomes](https://www.malariagen.net/projects/ag1000g), as well as studying the role of alternative splicing and transcriptome variation in insecticide resistance. Alternative splicing of transcripts is a fast-evolving layer of transcriptomic regulation that bears enormous potential to understand the rapid emergence of resistance mechanisms in natural mosquito populations.
